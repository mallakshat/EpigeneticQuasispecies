This contains code and data for manuscript titled "Epigenetic variation can promote adaptation by smoothing rugged fitness landscapes" - https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.06.658353

The scripts to generate fitness landscapes are - 
CreatingLandscapes.R (to create a set of correlated fitness landscapes which form the main part of the paper)
CreatingLandscapes_HoC.R (following the house of cards model to create a set of uncorrelated landscapes)
